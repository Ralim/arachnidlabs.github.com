Arachnid Labs is a one-man operation based out of London, UK. The man behind the wheel is [Nick Johnson](http://blog.notdot.net/), who you may know from his regular hack-a-day apperances for projects like [iZac the Android Bartender](http://hackaday.com/2011/11/17/kitchen-hacks-an-android-bartender/), the [stackable motor shield](http://hackaday.com/2011/08/17/a-stackable-motor-driver-shield-for-the-arduino/), the [circular sand plotter](http://hackaday.com/2012/04/26/zen-rock-garden-table-uses-magnets-and-sand/) and the [advice machine](http://hackaday.com/2012/09/26/machine-offers-cheap-advice-charges-more-for-something-profound/).

My goal is to make interesting, functional, and high quality electronics stuff, both for my own enjoyment and that of other hobbyists. We'll be releasing our first kits and products over the coming weeks and months, so keep an eye out!
