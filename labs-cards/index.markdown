The circuit pattern trading cards are a deck of 32 unique cards, each of which has a unique description and illustration of a common concept in electronics design. Topics covered include analog, digital, and power electronics.

The cards are printed on a deluxe card stock such as you'd find in a high quality deck of playing cards, and come packaged in an attractive custom tuckbox.

The cards are a great reference for all skill levels, and cover a range of topics, from simple ones such as LED current limiting, up to more difficult ones such as capacitative voltage boosters.
