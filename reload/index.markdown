This page is about Re:load v1. You're probably looking for [the Re:load 2 page](/reload-2/)

Re:load is an adjustable constant-current load with several key properties:

 - Cheap. $15 for the 0-3A version!
 - Self-powered. A general purpose dummy load shouldn't need external power, and Re:load doesn't.
 - Versatile. Operates over 3.3 to 30V, and at 0-3A for the regular version or 0-6A for the 'epic' version. Handle up to 12W continuous (regular) or 20W continuous (epic), or more with your own jumbo heatsink.
 - Virtually indestructable. As long as you don't exceed 30V, there's not much you can do to damage this. ESD, overcurrent, overtemperature and reverse polarity are all protected against.
 - Small. Chuck it in your toolbox once you're done and pull it out when you need it next.

You can read a detailed post about Re:load's construction and specifications [here](/blog/2013/02/05/introducing-re-load/).

For detailed assembly and usage instructions, see [here](instructions.html).
