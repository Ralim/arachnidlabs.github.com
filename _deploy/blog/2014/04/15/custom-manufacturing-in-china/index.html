	<h1>Custom manufacturing in China</h1>
	<img src="" />
 
<p>One of the primary requirements for the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nickjohnson/re-load-pro-a-dc-active-load">Re:Load Pro</a> was an enclosure and heatsink. The two need to integrate well - ideally with the heatsink taking the part of one end-panel - and the heatsink needs to be sufficiently large for the heat dissipation requirements of the Re:load Pro. After much searching, I came to the reluctant conclusion that such an enclosure doesn’t presently exist, and that my only option was to get the enclosure, the heatsink, or both custom manufactured.</p>

<p>I’ve sourced parts from Chinese manufacturers before, including getting parts, such as the <a href="https://www.tindie.com/products/arachnidlabs/8x8-pixel-square-pixel-led-matrix-yellow-green/">LED matrices</a> for the <a href="https://www.tindie.com/products/arachnidlabs/minishift/">Minishift</a> and <a href="https://www.tindie.com/products/arachnidlabs/minimatrix/">Minimatrix</a> made to order, but sourcing something with high setup costs, such as a custom extrusion, was a new experience.</p>

<p>Step one was to design a part and generate a suitable manufacturing drawing from which to quote. I took the dimensions of an existing heatsink, along with <a href="http://www.aavid.com/product-group/extrusions-na/custom">various design guides</a> and produced this design:</p>

<p><img src="/images/heatsink_drawing.png" width="500" /></p>

<p>I found some suppliers on aliexpress who seemed to specialise in heatsink extrusions, and shopped it around to them. I got quotes back from a number of suppliers, with a wide range of prices. Tooling/mold fees ranged from $500USD to $1,300, while per-unit prices ranged from $1.85 each to $3.50, and they all had minimum orders around 500 pieces. Most were willing to negotiate down on the MOQ in order to get a sale, but some additionally had an additional setup fee if you ordered less than a certain weight of aluminium.</p>

<p>I ended up picking a supplier towards the lower end of the price range, though not the absolute cheapest, with a tooling cost of $600, and a per-unit cost of $2.30, and authorising them to go ahead and produce the mould. This was an occasion for some paranoia, since unlike the CNC and 3d printing processes we’re all used to being a bit blase with, any screwups here would necessitate a new mould, and another $600 tooling fee.</p>

<p>The breakdown of the per-unit costs were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$0.85 material cost</li>
  <li>$0.09 ‘blanking’ cost</li>
  <li>$1 For post-extrusion CNC</li>
  <li>$0.17 to anodise each unit black</li>
  <li>$0.17 packaging</li>
</ul>

<p>Tooling took some time: nearly a month, though that was interrupted by Chinese New Year, which extended things somewhat. The tooling fee includes production of 3 sample units, which arrived a week later. I couldn’t be happier with the quality of the extrusion, machining, and finish:</p>

<p><img src="/images/heatsink_photo.jpg" width="500" /></p>

<p>These are the exact extrusions you’ll get as part of your enclosure if you <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nickjohnson/re-load-pro-a-dc-active-load">back the Re:load Pro</a>.</p>

<p>Although one data point isn’t a lot to work from, I’ve found the whole experience to be surprisingly straightforward and hassle-free so far, though I’ll report back when I’ve ordered the final extrusions for the production run. A few things to bear in mind when considering ordering custom work from China yourself:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Get multiple quotes from different manufacturers. The range in both setup and per-unit costs was enormous across different suppliers.</li>
  <li>Ask for photos and drawings of other work they’ve done. I avoided the cheapest supplier because they seemed suspiciously cheap, and didn’t have much evidence of other high quality work.</li>
  <li>Ask for a drawing of their own or other evidence they’ve understood your technical drawings correctly and will produce them to spec. The manufacturer I used included a drawing of the extrusion with their quote.</li>
  <li>Make sure you get samples to test the production quality, fit and finish before placing a full scale order.</li>
  <li>Make sure you fully understand the MOQ and any setup fees before ordering anything.</li>
</ul>

<p>Have you had custom work done in China? What was your experience with it like?</p>
