	  		<h1>Introducing the Circuit Patterns Trading Cards</h1>
	    	
    			<p>One of the more popular items at our booth at <a href="http://makerfaireelephantandcastle.com/">ECMMF</a> yesterday was the new Circuit Patterns Trading Cards. This is an idea I’ve been working on for a little while. Each card has a circuit diagram and a short description of a common circuit design pattern. Topics covered include analog, digital, and power electronics. They were hugely popular at the faire, and I even had people asking if they could buy whole decks.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.tindie.com/products/arachnidlabs/circuit-patterns-trading-cards-full-deck/"><img src="/images/labs-cards.png" /></a></p>

<p>There’s 32 cards in total, and from now on each kit we ship out will include one. If you don’t want to have to buy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupon_collector's_problem">130</a> kits to get the whole set, you can now <a href="https://www.tindie.com/products/arachnidlabs/circuit-patterns-trading-cards-full-deck/">buy a deck for just $10</a>.</p>

<p>If you’ve got errata, ideas for improving them, or you’ve come up with something interesting to do with them (snap? top trumps?), <a href="mailto:nick@arachnidlabs.com">let us know</a>!</p>

<p>The new Circuit Patterns Trading Cards were well received - so much so I’m going to be offering whole packs for sale on Tindie in the very near future. Minimatrix was also a big hit - and if you’re one of the people who wanted one, add yourself to the notification list <a href="https://www.tindie.com/products/arachnidlabs/minimatrix/">here</a> and you’ll get an email when they’re ready to go, in about a week.</p>

    			<p>Arachnid Labs is going to be at the <a href="http://makerfaireelephantandcastle.com/">Elephant and Castle Mini Maker Faire</a>! This is our first event of any sort, so it’ll be an interesting experience. While there, I’ll be showing off and selling Re:load and Minimatrix, as well as talking to people about maker culture, and my experiences turning a hobby into a business. Also, there will be Candy. I promise.</p>

<p>I’ll also be stocking some of the kits from <a href="https://www.tindie.com/stores/electriclaboratory/">Electric Laboratory</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, I’ve been working on a cool little giveaway to include in future kits - something to top the mix-and-match robots I already include - and I’ll be showing it off and giving it away for the first time at the Maker Faire. Come see!</p>

    			<p>Now that the test units have arrived, and I’ve assembled and tested some, I’m happy to announce that <a href="https://www.tindie.com/products/arachnidlabs/reload-the-simple-robust-affordable-dummy-load/">Re:load 2</a> is ready to go!</p>

<p>The production units haven’t yet arrived, but they should be no more than a couple of weeks off, so in the meantime I’m taking preorders on Tindie. If you order now, your Re:load will ship as soon as it arrives at my door. As an extra incentive, during the preorder period only, you can have 20% off using the code 1A09906.</p>

<p>A short overview of the improvements from v1:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mounting holes and improved options for mounting the components on the Re:load for your custom case</li>
  <li>Increased voltage range, from 3.1 volts to 40 volts, with full reverse bias protection</li>
  <li>Option to power the Re:load from an external supply to support voltages from 0 to 60 volts</li>
  <li>Configurable potentiometer orientation, for more flexible enclosure options.</li>
  <li>Configurable FET placement, for more flexible enclosure options.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can preorder a <a href="https://www.tindie.com/products/arachnidlabs/reload-the-simple-robust-affordable-dummy-load/">Re:load 2 here</a>, or an <a href="https://www.tindie.com/products/arachnidlabs/epic-reload-the-simple-robust-powerful-adjustable-dummy-load/">Epic Re:load 2 here</a>.</p>

	  		<h1>Announcing Re:load v2</h1>
	    	
    			<p>Re:load 2 is now available for preorder! See <a href="http://www.arachnidlabs.com/blog/2013/06/09/re-load-2-now-available-for-preorder/">this post</a> for details.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.tindie.com/products/arachnidlabs/reload-the-simple-robust-affordable-dummy-load/">Re:load</a>, Arachnid Labs’ DC dummy load project, has been hugely - and somewhat unexpectedly - popular. When I first listed it, I expected to get 10, maybe even 20 preorders; instead there were over 100. Since then, it’s continued to sell well, and we’re now nearly out of kits - the regular Re:load just sold out, and stock for Epic Re:loads is almost as scarce.</p>

<p>Clearly the time for a new run has arrived, and what better time to make some improvements? The basic premise and design of the Re:load has proven to be fundamentally sound, but there’s always a few improvements that can be made. I’ve taken the best suggestions and ideas from the community along with a few of my own, and put them together when designing version 2.</p>

<p><img src="https://github.com/arachnidlabs/reload/raw/master/reload-layout.png" width="400" /></p>

<!-- more -->

<p>First of all, the whole design has been converted to surface mount. Re:load made a great and straightforward thru-hole kit, but it only barely fit into its chosen form factor. Switching to surface mount allowed me to improve the design without giving up Re:load’s compact size. It also made available a much wider range of kits.</p>

<p>Switching to surface mount also made it possible to add mounting holes, as you can see. People have come up with a number of clever ways of mounting Re:load, and with proper mounting holes, I hope to see a lot more. Also in the form factor department, solder jumpers are provided to allow you to reverse the direction the potentiometer operates, so you can mount it on the bottom of the board without affecting the potentiometer’s operation, and an alternate footprint for the FET is provided right at the edge of the PCB, in case you’d like to mount it to a larger heatsink, or a heatsink case.</p>

<p>Next up in the form factor changes, the spring terminals are gone. All Re:load v2 units will ship with binding posts that screw straight into the PCB, for the best of both worlds.</p>

<p>The test terminals have also changed. They’re now 0.1” spaced, so you can attach a standard header, and a VIN pin has joined the sense pins. You can use this to sense the voltage across the Re:load.</p>

<p>Also new is a solder jumper for self-power. It’s bridged by default, meaning Re:load v2 is powered by the device under test just like Re:load v1. But if you’d like, you can remove the jumper, and power Re:load from the Vin pin, allowing you to use it over a wider range, from 0 to 60 volts!</p>

<p>I’ve saved the best for last. The Re:load’s previous LDO regulator, used to power the opamp and related circuitry, has been replaced with the <a href="http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm2936.pdf">LM2936</a>. This regulator has some fantastic features that really enhance the Re:load. It’s got built in protection against being reverse biased, so we can drop the schottky diode that was required to protect the regulator. In turn, this means you can now use Re:load at full power with voltages barely over 3 volts with full reverse bias protection, where Re:load v1 only went down to 4 volts before the current limit started decreasing. At the other end of the scale, the LM2936 tolerates input voltages up to 40 volts, up from 30.</p>

<p>So in short:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mounting holes and improved options for mounting the components on the Re:load for your custom case</li>
  <li>Increased voltage range, from 3.1 volts to 40 volts, with full reverse bias protection</li>
  <li>Option to power the Re:load from an external supply to support voltages from 0 to 60 volts</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m also getting this batch of Re:loads professionally assembled by <a href="http://smart-prototyping.com/">Smart Prototyping</a>. This is the first time I’ve farmed out assembly services, so it’ll be interesting to see how it goes - you can be certain I’ll be writing up my experience with the process here on the blog.</p>
