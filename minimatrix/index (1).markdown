Minimatrix is a tiny (3cm x 3cm) battery powered LED matrix display,
reprogrammable over infra-red. It displays marquee text and short
animations, which can be programmed using an infrared remote control
or from a computer via an Arduino or similar development platform. You
can even use it as an interactive display by updating it live!
