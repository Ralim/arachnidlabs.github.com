Re:load 2 is an adjustable constant-current load with several key properties:

 - Cheap. $15 for the 0-3A version!
 - Self-powered. A general purpose dummy load shouldn't need external power, and Re:load doesn't.
 - Versatile. Operates over 3.3 to 40V, and at 0-3A for the regular version or 0-6A for the 'epic' version. Handle up to 12W continuous (regular) or 20W continuous (epic), or more with your own jumbo heatsink.
 - Virtually indestructable. As long as you don't exceed 40V, there's not much you can do to damage this. ESD, overcurrent, overtemperature and reverse polarity are all protected against.
 - Small. Chuck it in your toolbox once you're done and pull it out when you need it next.
 - Mounting holes for convenient mounting to a custom case
 - Option to power the Re:load from an external supply to support voltages from 0 to 60 volts
 - Configurable potentiometer orientation, for more flexible enclosure options.
 - Configurable FET placement, for more flexible enclosure options.
