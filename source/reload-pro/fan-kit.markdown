This is a fan kit for the Re:load Pro, containing everything you need to boost your Re:load Pro's sustained power limit from 25 watts to 50 watts! It includes a fan controller PCB with dual smart fan controllers, fans, and mounting hardware to attach it to your Re:load Pro.

Assembly instructions for the fan kit can be found <a href="fan-kit-assembly.html">here</a>.

The fan kit is [available on Tindie](https://www.tindie.com/products/arachnidlabs/reload-pro-fan-kit/).

Images are of a late prototype; the production units will have proper standoffs and an improved PCB design.

The kit includes a populated PCB with dual smart fan controllers, and all
parts and mounting hardware required to set it up on your Re:load Pro. Fan speed
is automatically managed to minimise fan noise and wasted power through a
thermocouple that detects heatsink temperature and adjusts fan speed accordingly.
The fan controller can also detect and restart stalled fans.

Under low load conditions, the fans are stationary. As load - and thus temperature -
increases, the fans start, gradually ramping up to full speed as needed to maintain
the temperature.

Basic soldering and assembly skills are required to add the fan kit to your
Re:load Pro. Full instructions will be provided.

Full contents:

 - Fully populated fan kit PCB
 - Thermocouple
 - Headers for attaching fan kit PCB to Re:load Pro expansion slot
 - Two 40mm fans
 - Aluminium mounting plate, standoffs and screws for attaching fans to Re:load Pro
 - 0.9mm hex key for removing the knob from the Re:load Pro front panel during disassembly

Preorders will close, cards will be billed, and production will begin on the 7th
of December.
