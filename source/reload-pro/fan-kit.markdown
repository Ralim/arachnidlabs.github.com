The Re:load Pro fan kit is an addon for the Re:load Pro that adds two digitally
controlled fans, which increase the Re:load Pro's sustained power dissipation
from 25 watts to approximately 50 watts.

Images are of a late prototype; the production units will have proper standoffs
and an improved PCB design.

The kit includes a populated PCB with dual smart fan controllers, and all
parts and mounting hardware required to set it up on your Re:load Pro. Fan speed
is automatically managed to minimimse fan noise and wasted power through a
thermocouple that detects heatsink temperature and adjusts fan speed accordingly.
The fan controller can also detect and restart stalled fans.

Under low load conditions, the fans are stationary. As load - and thus temperature -
increases, the fans start, gradually ramping up to full speed as needed to maintain
the temperature.

Basic soldering and assembly skills are required to add the fan kit to your
Re:load Pro. Full instructions will be provided.

Full contents:

 - Fully populated fan kit PCB
 - Thermocouple
 - Headers for attaching fan kit PCB to Re:load Pro expansion slot
 - Two 40mm fans
 - Aluminium mounting plate, standoffs and screws for attaching fans to Re:load Pro
 - 0.9mm hex key for removing the knob from the Re:load Pro front panel during disassembly

The fan kit is now available for preorder! Fan kits are expected to ship in
January next year. Preorder now to get 20% off the regular retail price of Â£25.

Preorders will close, cards will be billed, and production will begin on the 7th
of December.
