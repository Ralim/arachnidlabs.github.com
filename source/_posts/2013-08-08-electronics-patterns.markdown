Coming from a software background to electronics, I tend to try and apply tools and techniques I learned in one to the other. Some skills and approaches transfer very well, while others don't. One that seems to transfer very well is the technique of looking at schematics in terms of [design patterns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern).

Design patterns are quite common in software, and provide an easy way to break down a system into components that you already understand, rather than trying to understand the system as one large piece. Happily, you can take much the same approach to analyzing, understanding, and composing electronic circuits.
