Welcome to Arachnid Labs! We're a one-man outfit based in London, England, and we're currently gearing up to provide a bunch of interesting Open Source Hardware kits and projects. Keep an eye out in coming days for lots of technical details on the first of these.

The man behind the lab is Nick Johnson, who you may recognize from his regular Hack a Day appearances for projects such as [iZac the android bartender](http://hackaday.com/2011/11/17/kitchen-hacks-an-android-bartender/), the [sand plotter](http://hackaday.com/2012/04/26/zen-rock-garden-table-uses-magnets-and-sand/), the [advice machine](http://hackaday.com/2012/09/26/machine-offers-cheap-advice-charges-more-for-something-profound/), and the [7400 logic FPGA](http://hackaday.com/2012/11/01/discrete-fpga-will-probably-win-the-7400-logic-competition/).
