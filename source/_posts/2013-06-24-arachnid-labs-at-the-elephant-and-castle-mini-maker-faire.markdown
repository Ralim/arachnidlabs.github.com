Arachnid Labs is going to be at the <a href="http://makerfaireelephantandcastle.com/">Elephant and Castle Mini Maker Faire</a>! This is our first event of any sort, so it'll be an interesting experience. While there, I'll be showing off and selling Re:load and Minimatrix, as well as talking to people about maker culture, and my experiences turning a hobby into a business. Also, there will be Candy. I promise.

I'll also be stocking some of the kits from <a href="https://www.tindie.com/stores/electriclaboratory/">Electric Laboratory</a>.

Finally, I've been working on a cool little giveaway to include in future kits - something to top the mix-and-match robots I already include - and I'll be showing it off and giving it away for the first time at the Maker Faire. Come see!
