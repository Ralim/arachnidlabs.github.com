One of the more popular items at our booth at [ECMMF](http://makerfaireelephantandcastle.com/) yesterday was the new Circuit Patterns Trading Cards. This is an idea I've been working on for a little while. Each card has a circuit diagram and a short description of a common circuit design pattern. Topics covered include analog, digital, and power electronics. They were hugely popular at the faire, and I even had people asking if they could buy whole decks.

There's 32 cards in total, and from now on each kit we ship out will include one. If you don't want to have to buy [130](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupon_collector's_problem) kits to get the whole set, you can now <a href="https://www.tindie.com/products/arachnidlabs/circuit-patterns-trading-cards-full-deck/">buy a deck for just $10</a>.

If you've got errata, ideas for improving them, or you've come up with something interesting to do with them (snap? top trumps?), <a href="mailto:nick@arachnidlabs.com">let us know</a>!
