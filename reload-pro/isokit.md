The first manufacturing run of Re:load Pros have an issue where the positive terminal of the load may become shorted to the enclosure of the Re:load Pro. This is resolved by the installation of a straightforward insulation kit, which provides an insulation barrier between the load and the enclosure. This page describes how to install your new isolation kit for your Re:load Pro.

Photographs and a video walkthrough are coming shortly.

# Disassembling the Re:load Pro

First, you need to disassemble the Re:load Pro.

Begin by taking the 0.9mm hex key included in the kit to undo the grub screw on the knob on the front of the Re:load Pro. Remove the knob and set it aside.

Use a phillips head screwdriver to remove the four screws from the front panel of the Re:load Pro. Carefully remove the front panel, taking care not to damage any of the connectors attached to it.

Use a fingernail or a flat head screwdriver to pull forward on the two tabs retaining the ribbon cable connector, and gently pull the ribbon cable connector free. Remove the three quick-connect connectors from the banana jacks. Set aside the front panel.

Now remove the four phillips head screws from the heatsink on the back of the Re:load Pro and set them aside. Carefully slide out the Re:load Pro PCB from the enclosure. Treat the PCB and heatsink carefully; the heatsink is heavy, and is connected to the PCB only by the TO220 FET and its screw, which is easily bent.

# Removing the FET from the heatsink

Using your phillips screwdriver, unscrew the FET from the heatsink. You can discard the screw now; a longer one is provided in the kit.

In some Re:load Pro units, the thermal paste rubberizes after some time, so removing the FET may require some effort. The easiest way to remove the FET if it's stuck to the heatsink is to take a 10mm or adjustable spanner, hold the heatsink firmly, and gently use the spanner to twist the FET until it comes loose.

Next, remove the old thermal paste from the PCB. Some IPA and a scraper may be helpful here if the thermal paste has set.

# Installing the isolator

Open the packet of thermal paste that came with the kit. Apply some to the back of the FET, and some to one side of the insulator (the white ceramic rectangle that came with the kit).

Put the heatsink on its back, with the area where the FET will attach facing upwards. Next, lay the insulator on the heatsink with the side with thermal paste on it facing down. Line the hole in the insulator up with the screw hole in the heatsink.

Take the bushing - the round black plastic part - and place it through the hole in the FET, with the narrow part facing away from the PCB. If you have a fan kit installed, place the fan kit's thermistor ring between the FET and the bushing. Slot the replacement screw through the bushing.

Line the FET up with the heatsink and insulator, and place the screw through the insulator and into the heatsink. Use the phillips head screwdriver to tighten the screw, being careful to keep everything lined up and straight while you do so.

# Reassembling the Re:load Pro

Slide the Re:load Pro back into the enclosure and secure the four screws connecting the heatsink to the enclosure.

Reattach the three quick-connect terminals to the front panel's banana jacks. Take care to connect them the correct way around; the blue connector on the right side of the front panel connects to the leftmost internal terminal, while the red and black banana jacks connect to the remaining red and black wires.

Carefully slot the ribbon connector for the display back into the ribbon cable connector on the PCB and push it in gently. Use fingernails or a flat-head screwdriver to push the retaining clips in so it is held securely.

Fasten the front panel on to the unit with the four phillips head screws. Reattach the knob using the supplied 0.9mm hex key, taking care to ensure it is at least 0.5mm out from the front panel so you can still press the encoder button.
