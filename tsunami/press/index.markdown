# About the Tsunami

The Tsunami is a powerful and flexible signal generator built on the Arduino platform. It's the best way to get started experimenting with analog signals, and a great tool for a huge variety of tasks, too.

The tsunami takes the versatile processor behind the Arduino Leonardo, and combines it with a Direct Digital Synthesis chip, which makes generating analog signals incredibly straightforward. It also has flexible input and output circuitry, and an easy to use software library, to make working with analog signals as easy as blinking an LED.

# About Arachnid Labs

Arachnid Labs is a one-man operation based out of London, UK. The man behind the wheel is [Nick Johnson](http://blog.notdot.net/), who you may know from his regular hack-a-day apperances for projects like [iZac the Android Bartender](http://hackaday.com/2011/11/17/kitchen-hacks-an-android-bartender/), the [stackable motor shield](http://hackaday.com/2011/08/17/a-stackable-motor-driver-shield-for-the-arduino/), the [circular sand plotter](http://hackaday.com/2012/04/26/zen-rock-garden-table-uses-magnets-and-sand/) and the [advice machine](http://hackaday.com/2012/09/26/machine-offers-cheap-advice-charges-more-for-something-profound/).

Arachnid Labs has successfully run and delivered one previous Kickstarter, for the [Re:load Pro active load](https://kickstarter.com/projects/nickjohnson/re-load-pro-a-dc-active-load).
