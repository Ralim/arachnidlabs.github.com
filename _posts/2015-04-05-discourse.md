In response to numerous requests, we've set up a discussion forum where you can talk about Arachnid Labs products, as well as general electronics and maker-related topics. It's up now at [discuss.arachnidlabs.com](http://discuss.arachnidlabs.com/), and linked in the menu at the top.

We're using the excellent [Discourse](http://www.discourse.org/) package to host the forums. You'll need to sign up to comment, but it supports single-signon via Google, Twitter, or Github if you don't want to create a new account.

We're also migrating blog comments over to use Discourse. Because migration is difficult, we've left old blog posts using Disqus for now; new ones (like this!) will use Discourse for comments.

Enjoy!
