Now that the test units have arrived, and I've assembled and tested some, I'm happy to announce that <a href="https://www.tindie.com/products/arachnidlabs/reload-the-simple-robust-affordable-dummy-load/">Re:load 2</a> is ready to go!

<a href="https://www.tindie.com/products/arachnidlabs/reload-the-simple-robust-affordable-dummy-load/"><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_NVZDZtSGks/UbTDM5SLi9I/AAAAAAAAECQ/Y684i0KLiiM/w469-h624-no/P1010320.JPG" width="400px"></a>

The production units haven't yet arrived, but they should be no more than a couple of weeks off, so in the meantime I'm taking preorders on Tindie. If you order now, your Re:load will ship as soon as it arrives at my door. As an extra incentive, during the preorder period only, you can have 20% off using the code 1A09906.

A short overview of the improvements from v1:

 - Mounting holes and improved options for mounting the components on the Re:load for your custom case
 - Increased voltage range, from 3.1 volts to 40 volts, with full reverse bias protection
 - Option to power the Re:load from an external supply to support voltages from 0 to 60 volts
 - Configurable potentiometer orientation, for more flexible enclosure options.
 - Configurable FET placement, for more flexible enclosure options.

You can preorder a <a href="https://www.tindie.com/products/arachnidlabs/reload-the-simple-robust-affordable-dummy-load/">Re:load 2 here</a>, or an <a href="https://www.tindie.com/products/arachnidlabs/epic-reload-the-simple-robust-powerful-adjustable-dummy-load/">Epic Re:load 2 here</a>.
