Time to introduce another of the initial set of Loki planks, the Prototyping Plank.

Every platform needs a prototyping board, and Loki's no exception. It may not be exciting, but it's certainly essential.

Besides the expected grid of prototyping holes, this one has some important features:

 * Breaks out 8 GPIO lines
 * Dedicated area for thru-hole DIP chips up to 24 pins wide
 * Convenient 3v3 power and gnd buses
 * General prototyping area
 * Square pads for easy soldering of SMT passives
 * Dedicated area for right-angle edge connectors on the left side of the board
 * Breaks out all power/config header pins
 
 There's not a great deal else to say about this one. I'm certain people will find it useful, though.
