Wow, it's been a while since I updated here with Re:load Pro news!

[The Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nickjohnson/re-load-pro-a-dc-active-load/), as you probably know by now, was a huge success, hitting over 400% of its original goal. I've been posting [regular updates](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nickjohnson/re-load-pro-a-dc-active-load/posts) to the Kickstarter, and that's the place to go if you want to keep up to date with it.

We hit a really significant milestone with production today: The first unit rolled off the line at the fab in Texas. Here it is in action:

The next steps entail sending it to me for validation and checking, then producing first the "first off the line" units, then the remainder of the order, for shipping to our loyal backers.

If you missed out on the Kickstarter, you can still preorder yours [at Tindie](https://www.tindie.com/products/arachnidlabs/reload-pro/).
