Ordered the parts for the Re:load kits today. Mostly from Farnell. I have a few parts to order from Future Electronics, but I'm having trouble trying to invoke their free shipping option. Definitely the biggest single electronics order I've ever placed.

My reflow oven arrived today. I posted a review of it on the Dangerous Prototypes forum [here](http://dangerousprototypes.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=68&t=5193). I'm very happy with it, though I wish even more now that I had a solder paste dispenser.

I spent some time working on another unreleased project. Hopefully this one will see the light of day shortly - keep an eye out.

Over the weekend, I plan to test out the Loki motor and sound planks, finally, and write up some getting started documentation for the Loki Alpha testers. I also plan to write up the kit instructions for the Re:load.
