It's what you've all - or at least some of you - have been waiting for: Minimatrix is now ready to go and officially for sale!

Initially it's available in Red and Orange, and you can get your Minimatrix as a kit [here for just $10](https://www.tindie.com/products/arachnidlabs/minimatrix/), or [fully assembled for just $15](https://www.tindie.com/products/arachnidlabs/minimatrix-fully-assembled/)!

And don't forget to [pick up a remote](https://www.tindie.com/products/arachnidlabs/hackers-ir-remote/) to go with it.
