Arachnid Labs is going to Shenzhen! I'll be in town from the 5th to the 9th as part of the [digital mission Shenzhen](http://chinwag.com/digitalmission/shenzhen14), attending the maker faire, and meeting up with friends and fellow makers from IRC.

Are you going to be in town? Look for me at the UKTI booth at Maker Faire, or leave a comment below!
