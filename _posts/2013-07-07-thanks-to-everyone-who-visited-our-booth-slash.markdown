Yesterday was the [Elephant and Castle Mini Maker Faire](http://makerfaireelephantandcastle.com/), and it was a blast! Thanks to everyone who showed up and said hi.

The new Circuit Patterns Trading Cards were well received - so much so I'm going to be offering whole packs for sale on Tindie in the very near future. Minimatrix was also a big hit - and if you're one of the people who wanted one, add yourself to the notification list [here](https://www.tindie.com/products/arachnidlabs/minimatrix/) and you'll get an email when they're ready to go, in about a week.

If you want to get in touch, you can email me at [nick@arachnidlabs.com](mailto:nick@arachnidlabs.com).
