The Minishift Python library and HTTP interface is [now available on GitHub](https://github.com/arachnidlabs/minishift-python/) and [in PyPi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/minishift-python/)!

Usage documentation can be found [here](/minishift/usage.html), too.

Finally, videos demonstrating [minishift assembly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKgj40gf_Nw) and [enclosure assembly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWxk8cZX4R4) are up on YouTube. Expect a full assembly instructions page soon.

Keep an eye out for a tutorial on using the Minishift from your Arduino, and an Arduino library, also coming soon.

And don't forget, you can still preorder your own minishifts [https://www.tindie.com/products/arachnidlabs/minishift/](https://www.tindie.com/products/arachnidlabs/minishift/) here, for shipment in a little over a week.
