[Talsit](http://talsit.org) built his Re:loads, with a couple of modifications:

He says:

<blockquote>I got the knobs at kyoritsu, my "local" electronics shop, at Den Den Town here in Osaka. As for banana pagando plugs, I'm using the female end of the LiPo battery connectors from hobbyking - I have a whole bunch of them an they fit.

And I've been doing more tests on my psu front end and this thing is proving so handy!</blockquote>

I love the build - and the presentation is brilliant too.

Have you hacked the Re:load in some fashion? Drop me <a href="mailto:nick@arachnidlabs.com">an email</a> and let me know.
