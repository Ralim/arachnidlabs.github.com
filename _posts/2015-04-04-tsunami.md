There's only 48 hours left to run on the Tsunami Kickstarter! We've crushed our goal, and we've got some cool stretch goals still to hit: if we make it to Â£17,500, everyone gets an upgraded 10-bit DAC!

This is your last chance to get a Tsunami at Kickstarter prices - it'll be substantially more expensive afterwards. What are you waiting for? <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nickjohnson/tsunami/">Back it now</a> before it's too late!
