We're going to be at Brighton Mini Maker Faire, tomorrow Saturday 7th September!

Come see us and say hi! We'll be demoing a totally rebuilt [sand plotter](http://hackaday.com/2012/04/26/zen-rock-garden-table-uses-magnets-and-sand/), as well as selling [Minimatrixes](https://www.tindie.com/products/arachnidlabs/minimatrix/), [Labs Cards](https://www.tindie.com/products/arachnidlabs/circuit-patterns-trading-cards-full-deck/), and [Re:loads](https://www.tindie.com/products/arachnidlabs/reload-the-simple-robust-affordable-dummy-load/)!

The faire is on from 10AM to 5:30 PM, at the Brighton Corn Exchange. Lots more details, and an opportunity to avoid lines and buy tickets ahead of time, can be found [here](http://www.makerfairebrighton.com/).
