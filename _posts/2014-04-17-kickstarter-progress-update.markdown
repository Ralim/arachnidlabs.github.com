The [Re:load Pro kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nickjohnson/re-load-pro-a-dc-active-load/) is barreling along! We reached the goal after just 32 hours, and after a boost from [an article on Hack a Day](http://hackaday.com/2014/04/16/reload-pro-an-open-source-active-load/), we've now reached Â£10,000 and unlocked the first stretch goal: an accessory port. Read all about it in the update [here](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nickjohnson/re-load-pro-a-dc-active-load/posts/813627)!

With 18 days to go, there's still plenty of time to [back the Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nickjohnson/re-load-pro-a-dc-active-load/) and get a Re:load Pro for yourself, and plenty of stretch goals still to meet.
