I'm delighted to announce that Tsunami is now officially a part of the [Arduino AtHeart program](http://www.arduino.cc/en/ArduinoAtHeart/HomePage)!

![Arduino AtHeart](/images/arduino-at-heart.png)

Arduino AtHeart is a program run by our good friends at Arduino LLC (who you may know as [arduino.cc](http://www.arduino.cc/)), and serves to identify products that are based on Arduino technology. The Arduino AtHeart marking means you can be confident the Tsunami will work and be fully supported by the Arduino IDE, and that you'll be able to use the same skills you've learned on Arduino boards such as the [Leonardo](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardLeonardo). A proportion of all Tsunami sales goes to Arduino LLC to support their excellent work on the Arduino platform.

Unless you've had your head buried in the sand, you'll have heard of the current situation around Arduino LLC vs Arduino SRL (formerly Smart Projects SRL). Here at Arachnid Labs, we're firmly behind Massimo and his band at Arduino LLC, as the true progenitors of the Arduino platform and community, and we're delighted to be able to support them in a tangible way by contributing back to the project that started it all.

If you'd like to help support the Real Arduino too, and you haven't already, you can [preorder a Tsunami here](https://www.crowdsupply.com/arachnid-labs/tsunami).
