We've just launched our next product, the Tsunami, and it's [up on Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nickjohnson/tsunami/)!

The Tsunami is a powerful and flexible signal generator built on the Arduino platform. It's the best way to get started experimenting with analog signals, and a great tool for a huge variety of tasks, too.

The tsunami takes the versatile processor behind the Arduino Leonardo, and combines it with a Direct Digital Synthesis chip, which makes generating analog signals incredibly straightforward. It also has flexible input and output circuitry, and an easy to use software library, to make working with analog signals as easy as blinking an LED. 

We're aiming for a Â£10,000 goal to be able to manufacture the Tsunami, and there's
just 21 days to get there. If it sounds like the sort of thing you'd find useful,
[go back it now](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nickjohnson/tsunami/)!
