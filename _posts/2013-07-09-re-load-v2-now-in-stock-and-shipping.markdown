Oops! Seems I forgot this all-important announcement in the rush of preparations for Maker Faire!

Re:load v2 is now in stock and shipping! The price is the same as ever, but v2 has a lot of improvements over v1:

 - Most parts are now surface-mount and come pre-soldered, saving you effort
 - Mounting holes and improved options for mounting the components on the Re:load for your custom case
 - Increased voltage range, from 3.3 volts to 40 volts, with full reverse bias protection
 - Option to power the Re:load from an external supply to support voltages from 0 to 60 volts
 - Configurable potentiometer orientation, for more flexible enclosure options.
 - Configurable FET placement, for more flexible enclosure options.
