As a bit of an experiment, I've put the Circuit Patterns Trading Cards [up on amazon.co.uk](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B00I2VX1GE). They're fulfilled by Amazon, so you can get all the usual shipping options such as free super-saver or prime shipping, as well as prompt delivery. They're in stock now for Â£8.99.

Of course, they're still [available on Tindie](https://www.tindie.com/products/arachnidlabs/circuit-patterns-trading-cards-full-deck/), too!
