Due to popular demand, I've done another run of the stencil8 tooling blocks with a fully populated grid of holes. If the [regular stencil8 blocks](https://www.tindie.com/products/arachnidlabs/pcb-fixture-block-for-solder-paste-stencilling/) aren't for you, you can order a [fully populated one](https://www.tindie.com/products/arachnidlabs/pcb-tooling-block-full-grid/) for just a bit more.
