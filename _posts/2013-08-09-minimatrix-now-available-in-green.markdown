Green LED matrixes are now available for the minimatrix! They're a lot brighter than the red and orange ones, and even use less power to boot, so the minimatrix will last longer on a battery.

You can get your minimatrix [here](https://www.tindie.com/products/arachnidlabs/minimatrix/) - or if you're just after the LED matrixes, you can get them on their own [here](https://www.tindie.com/products/arachnidlabs/8x8-pixel-square-pixel-led-matrix-yellow-green/).
