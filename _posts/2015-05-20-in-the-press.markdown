Wired have a [great article](http://www.wired.com/2015/05/making-hardware-total-pain-not-factory/) up about [MacroFab](http://www.macrofab.net/), [Crowd Supply](https://www.crowdsupply.com/), and us! It's a good explanation of how MacroFab are making it easier for us and others to manufacture small run electronics affordably in the US. We couldn't be happier with MacroFab, so we're delighted to see them getting press!

Crowd Supply have also [written a post](http://blog.crowdsupply.com/post/119318212259/macrofab) about MacroFab, based on our experiences.

Are you thinking of using MacroFab for your own projects, or sending them to China? Tell us about it on the forum.
